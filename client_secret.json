//Save your client secret to this file. 

This can be done starting at: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials. For those who haven't created a credential for Google's API, after clicking the link above (and logging in to the appropriate account),

Select/create the project that this authentication is for (if creating a new project make sure to configure the OAuth consent screen; you only need to set an Application name)

Click on the "Dashboard" tab, then "Enable APIs and Services". Search for Gmail and enable.

Click on the Credentials tab, then "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".

Select what kind of application this is for, and give it a memorable name. Fill out all necessary information for the credential (e.g., if choosing "Web Application" make sure to add an Authorized Redirect URI. See https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2 for more infomation).

Back on the credentials screen, click the download icon next to the credential you just created to download it as a JSON object.

Save this file as "client_secret.json" and place it in the root directory of your application. (The Gmail class takes in an argument for the name of this file if you choose to name it otherwise.)
